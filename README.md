# RATP-Go
===

## Why Golang?
I think it's perfect for typed objects with WSDL

## Hell to heaven?
- RATP API is a bit shitty
- Only human values for some fields
- Sometime we get `NullPointerException` in the body of the response
- Some functions just don't work

** And this is fucking XML! **

## Can I contribute?
Yes, of course
