# RATP-Go

## Why Golang?
I think it's perfect for typed objects with WSDL

## Hell to heaven?
- RATP API is a shitty
- Only human values for some fields
- Sometime we get `NullPointerException` in the body of the response
- Some functions just don't work
- When you use `78` instead `RB` (it's the same line, different id) you don't have the same information

**And this is fucking XML!**

## Can I contribute?
Yes, of course, welcome to hell!
